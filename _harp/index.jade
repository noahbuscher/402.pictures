          | Let's be real: one of the hardest things about being a photographer in the 
          | Midwest is the supossed lack of photo locations, expecially if you don't 
          | have access to a studio! That's where we come in... for $20/hour you
          | can have your own studio space and meeting room that you can use to take portraits,
          | artisitc shoots, do product photography, and get crazy!

          | you waiting for?
