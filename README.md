# My Personal Site

So this is like the homestead. The good 'ol personal site. Here is the place where I collect and keep track of all my crazy ventures. Feel free to copy this site and make it your own.

## Development

Just run `harp serve _harp` to start serving the source.

## Deployment

Run `harp compile _harp ./` to compile to the root directly. Publishing is as simple as uploading to GitHub Pages.
